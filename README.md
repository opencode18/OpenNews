# How I made it 

Vue JS is used to fetch JSON through the API and the resulting data is stored in an array with the respective names.The data stored in the First 5 index's are used to display the news in the flip cards.The Front end of the website is made by using simple HTML and CSS.The API used in this website is News API.Vue JS was preferred in parsing the JSON because of the simplicity in using it to parse the JSON data. As of now Arrays containing data of only 5 technical websites are present in OpenNews.
